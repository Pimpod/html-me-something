      <title>My Experience Playing the Pokemon Card Game</title>

   <body><p>I first got interested in playing the Pokemon Trading Card Game (PTCG) in 2011. I started playing at a local card shop and eventually, my brother and dad also started to play with me. We all spent our first year playing trying to get better. We weren't the best at the game, but we all had a drive to get better. We began to take the game serious and travel to events all across the country. In my second year playing, I finally got a hang on the game. I eneded up winning my first city championships, getting 4th place at a state championships, and placing in the top 64 at the 2013 Pokemon National Championships. This year really help sparked my passion for playing and improving.</p></body>
